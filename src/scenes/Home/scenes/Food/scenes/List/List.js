                 How Eating Like a Professional Bodybuilder Can Make You Fat
          </div>

              Now that that's out of the way, what about that style of eating could cause an average
              gym goer to get a little thicker around the middle? Well, there are a few things.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              1. Calories: Most fitness enthusiasts—even the one who are really into it—don't spend hours at the gym 
              training a body part. They have limited time to work out, and as a result, they simply aren't expending the 
              same amount of energy as a bodybuilder. Six meals a day can add up quickly. If you aren't perfectly
              portioning out every meal, you could easily go over your maintenance or fat-loss totals and find yourself
              in a surplus. 
              <br/>
              </div>
              <img src = {foodImage1} />
              </div>
              2. Meal frequency: Somewhere along the line it became established that eating frequently (as in every two hours or so) would rev up
              your metabolism, like stoking a fire. But scientific evidence doesn't necessarily support this. “Meal frequency does not boost metabolism,
              ”Roussell said. In fact, too much protein intake can cause your body to build up a tolerance. That means  you won't effectively utilize dietary
              protein as opposed to if you spaced out your meals more. Roussell suggests waiting at least two hours to eat after a liquid protein, like BCAAs
              or a shake, or four hours after a solid meal.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <div className="rightImage" >
              <div>
              3. Carbohydrates: No, they aren't the devil, but if you want to get shredded, intake needs to be 
              monitored. Again, these massive dudes are using up a ton of energy, and their  carbohydrate intake 
              requirements will be higher than the average lifter. Roussell suggests  keeping your starchiest carbs
              contained to your post-workout meal or in the morning. And if you aren’t satisfied with the results,
              eliminate the starchy carbs from breakfast.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              <img src = {foodImage2} />

              </div>
              4. Longevity: Do you want to eat chicken breasts and broccoli forever? Even bodybuilders
              cycle their diet, eating more calories during the off season to pack on muscle, and then
              changing their diet to shed pounds of body fat for competitions. It's a tough lifestyle that  requires a lot of commitment, and most of us are 
              more interested in staying reasonably lean year round instead of swinging between gaining and losing weight. Plain and simple, bodybuilders
              ultimately have different goals, and their lives revolve around getting up on  stage at sub-10 percent body fat.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But there definitely are 
              takeaways from a bodybuilding diet that can help the average person build muscle and burn excess body fat.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              1. Protein: Most of us don’t eat enough of it. But if you want to feel satisfied after a meal and have the proper nutrients to build muscle, you 
              want to consume at least 30g per meal. This number will trigger your body’s ability to optimally synthesize protein, and is the minimum amount 
              needed to for a satiety response. In other words, you are more likely to be satisfied eating four meals with 30g minimum of protein, than 6 to 8
              meals with less protein.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              2. Planning: Bodybuilders plan out their meals, leaving nothing to chance. Whether it be meal prep for the week, or keeping protein powder at t
              he office so you aren’t stuck trying to sneak lunch out of the office candy jar, a little planning goes a long way. Bodybuilders also keep things
              simple, which leads to consistency. People want variety in their minds, but they tend to prefer simplicity when it comes to real life nutrition
              plans, according to Roussell.
              <br/>

              <div>
              3. Hydration: They drink a lot of water. You should too. For one, liquid calories do not satiate, said Roussell, so it’s easy to
              get into a caloric surplus with liquid calories. Studies have also shown that drinking water with meals reduces overall calorie
              intake. And while there's no scientific standard regarding the amount of water you should drink. the general
              recommendations are nine glasses a day for women and 13 for men. (This also includes the water in drinks like tea and
              coffee.)

              </div>
              <br/>
              <br/>

              4. Portion sizes: Just like bodybuilders plan, they track. You don’t have to be obsessive, but keep an eye on portion sizes to help you monitor 
              your caloric intake.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              5. Food choices: Sticking to lean meat and vegetables as the centerpiece of your meal is a great fat loss strategy. And grilling or broiling them
              versus frying them will save calories. Basing your intake of grains and starchy vegetables on your activity level will help keep you on track.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              So here’s the deal: If you aren’t a bodybuilder, a textbook bodybuilding diet is most likely not for you. Not only is it not practical, but it’s part of
              a very specific lifestyle. You can’t extract the diet from the lifestyle and expect it to have the same effect. However, there are aspects of a 
              bodybuilder’s diet you can learn from and apply to your own diet if you are looking to shed fat and build muscle.

                 Diet and Nutrition for Woman
          </div>
          <div className = "description">
            <p>
            It doesn’t matter how hard you are training in the gym, if you aren’t eating the right foods at the right time, all of your efforts will have been in vain. You can’t out-train a bad diet, which is why we’re going to share a few diet and nutritional secrets with you before leaving.
            Remember, we’re looking at the ultimate 5-day workout routine for women to get strong and toned, and if you’re not eating right, you will become neither strong, nor toned.
            Here are some tried and tested methods proven to give great results.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Drink enough water
            When it comes to exercise and health in general, adequate hydration is crucial.
            Water makes up close to 80% of our bodies, and we need it to perform even the most basic of physiological processes. Without adequate amounts of water in our bodies, we run the risk of dehydrating, which can affect athletic performance, and our health in general.
            When we exercise, we perspire and can lose important electrolytes via our sweat. This is why it’s important to stay well hydrated during exercise, to help replenish the fluids, minerals, and electrolytes we lost through training.
            Aim for 2.5 litres of mineral water per day. Failing that, filtered water is still very good for you.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2. Get plenty of healthy protein
            Protein is vital for muscle growth and repair. If you want to become strong and/or toned, you need to make sure you are taking enough protein in each day.
            Aim for around 0.6 – 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, and be sure to spread it out evenly throughout the day. Look for lean and healthy sources like fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, nuts, seeds, dairy, and grass-fed red meat.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            3. Invest in a good quality whey protein
            Providing you can consume whey, whey protein is a supplement you will need to invest in if you wish to build muscle and burn fat.
            Whey protein shakes are perfect because one shake provides around 30 or more grams of protein per serving. They’re easy to make, convenient, they taste great, and they’re full of other nutrients that the muscles thrive upon.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            4. Don’t forget your veggies
            As well as protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs, you will also need to make sure you are eating plenty of vegetables.
            Vegetables are full of digestive-friendly dietary fiber, they’re rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they help to give your meals extra texture and flavour.
            Don’t rely on vitamin supplements alone when it comes to nutrient intakes, instead, make sure you eat plenty of fresh vegetables each day.
